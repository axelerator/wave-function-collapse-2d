# Wave Function Collapse

The [Wave Function Collapse](https://gist.github.com/selfsame/e7ff11205c316888977f9cac04fe4035) algorithm
is a popular approach to generate random maps or boards from smaller tiles.

By progressively excluding invalid combinations and picking random tiles based on what's left over
we can generate many variations of valid landscapes.
